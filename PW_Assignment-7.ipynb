    "'''What is Abstraction in OOps? Explain with an example.'''\n",
    "# Answer:\n",
    "\"\"\"Abstraction is a fundamental concept in Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) that focuses on simplifying complex reality by modeling classes based on the essential characteristics and behavior of objects. It involves the creation of abstract classes and interfaces that define the structure and methods that derived classes (concrete classes) must implement. Abstraction allows you to hide the intricate implementation details and only expose the necessary features to the outside world.\"\"\""

    "\n",
    "\"\"\"The abc module in Python stands for \"Abstract Base Classes.\" It is a module within the Python standard library that provides mechanisms to define and work with abstract classes. Abstract classes are classes that cannot be instantiated themselves but serve as templates for creating concrete subclasses. They define a set of methods that subclasses must implement, ensuring a certain level of consistency and structure in derived classes.\n",

    "Abstract Base Classes (ABCs): You can create abstract classes using the abc.ABC class as a base. Abstract methods, which are methods without implementations, are defined within these classes. Subclasses of these abstract base classes are required to provide implementations for these abstract methods.\n",

    "Abstract Methods: Abstract methods are declared using the @abstractmethod decorator. Any class that inherits from an abstract base class with abstract methods must implement these methods, providing concrete implementations.\n",
